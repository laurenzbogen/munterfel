u﻿rlove. was one of our first songs\
from the very beginning it sounded like the memories of a relationship gone by, with neither participant actively contributing to that estrangement, but also noone initiating 
o﻿ne of the first challenges with urlove was finding a sound that, despite the relatively "jazzy" harmonies throughout the track could keep urlove in a similar world to our other songs.

n﻿oteworthy is the second part of the chorus which has a more dominant focus than most our other track which tend to be more subdominant-based, and also the other half of it, which includes a backdoor dominant like C-Major du conclude its seconded phrase.

t﻿he therefore created synth sounds are fourfold: \
A﻿ characteristic pluck-like synth for the verse, that plays in dialouge with a belllike, eighties sounding pad, taken straight from the legendary Roland D50. Then a very munterfelly Sawstab sound, which also very typically comes in in the chorus and then takes over the verse part of the first sound, to open up the third verse. Lastly, a live oriented synth not unlike the first verse synth takes over the bridge, but brings a more roomish and small quality with it, that then opens up again for the last choruses.

T﻿his opening and closing of sounds contributes to the narrative focused style of the song, and takes the harmonies from an ellaborate to a more catchy place in general and also thorughout the course of the song.
